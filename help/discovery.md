_Will this repository tell me how to solve a mission? Aren't we taking the fun out of it? One of the FLL Core Values is DISCOVERY. As long as this repository exists, won't other teams be able to copy our code and not experience the thrill of DISCOVERY?_

Great points! Discovery is very important and we want to embrace that core value, just like all of the rest.

But seeing our code here really doesn't tell you anything. If I told you that for a certain mission, we are going to drive 268mm, then operate the left attachment motor for -220 degrees, and then do a turn of 105 degrees, and another drive, and so on and so on, you get the point. Those instructions are meaningless. And that is exactly what you will see when you look at our mission code--a bunch of meaningless instructions. You need to have the EXACT same robot as us, and the EXACT same attachment. You have to know how to load and set up the attachment and robot. You also need to know the start position in base. You need to know what the robot drivers are doing before, during and after each run. None of those details are available here. The mission code is in the repo to make it easier for our team to collaborate, not to give out solutions. Even our BaseRobot class is useless outside of our team unless your team does things the same way we do, and your color sensor is calibrated the same as ours, drivebase is set up the same, etc.  

Instead, if you are looking through our repository here, then what you should really be getting are IDEAS and INSPIRATION, and a better understanding of pybricks and how to collaborate using VS Code, python, and github. Maybe you never heard of pybricks, but you want to see how an FLL team is using it to get a better idea if it is a possible good fit for your team. Or just to see if python is a good language for FLL robots (we think it is!). Or maybe you want to see how a master program works under pybricks. Or a BaseRobot class. Or how to configure VS Code for FLL teams. We'd love to help you with any of those questions. But there's no real code here that can be copied and pasted into any other team's codebase. It just doesn't work that way.  

So please don't just come here and copy all of our code. That's not cool and it's not fun. And it won't help. Instead, drop us a note to let us know how we helped your team, or ask us questions. We are happy to help, but we want you to have a chance to DISCOVER your own solutions!
