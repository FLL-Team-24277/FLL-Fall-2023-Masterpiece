_Will this repository tell me how to solve a mission? Aren't we taking the fun out of it? One of the FLL Core Values is DISCOVERY. If we have this repository, other teams won't be able to experience the thrill of DISCOVERY._

Great points! Discovery is very important and we want to embrace that core value, just like all of the rest. But seeing our code here really doesn't tell you anything. If I told you that for a certain mission, we are going to drive 268mm, the operate the left attachment motor for -220 degrees, and then do a turn of 105 degrees, and another drive, you get the point. Those instructions are meaningless. You need to have the EXACT same robot as us, and the EXACT same attachment. While we do have the instructions for how we build our base robot, we will never put instructions here for how we build our attachments.

Instead, if you are looking through our repository here, then what you should really be getting are IDEAS and INSPIRATION. Maybe you never heard of pybricks, but you want to see how an FLL team is using it to get a better idea if it is a possible good fit for your team. Or just to see if python is a good language for FLL robots (we think it is!)

So please don't just come here and copy all of our code and build our robot. That's not cool and it's not fun. Instead, drop us a note to let us know how we helped your team, or ask us questions. We are happy to help, but we want you to have a chance to DISCOVER your own solutions!
