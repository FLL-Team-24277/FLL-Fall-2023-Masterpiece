# Windows software that FLL teams using pybricks might need:

VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/  
Editing python programs. Use the "System Installer".

Python 3 https://www.python.org/  
It's python. Install in c:\python\ (use the "custom installation" option)

git for Windows https://git-scm.com/downloads  
Be sure to select VS code as your default editor.

pybricks https://pybricks.com/ https://code.pybricks.com/ and https://beta.pybricks.com/  
Nothing to install on your computer, but you will need to install it on your robot.

And completely optional:  
Lego Spike App https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/spike-app/software  
Every once in a while you will need the official Lego Spike app. But know that if using pybricks, the Spike app will not be able to connect to the hub.

git Desktop for windows https://desktop.github.com/  
Gives a bit more integration with git and github. Some people love it. I never use it. I feel like all the integration you need is perfect within VS Code.
