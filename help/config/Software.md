# Windows software that FLL teams might need:

Stud.io https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page

If you are just using the built-in word blocks or python from within the Spike app, then no need to go any further

Python 3 https://www.python.org/
It's python

VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/
Editing python programs

git for Windows https://git-scm.com/downloads

git Desktop for windows https://desktop.github.com/
Gives a bit more integration with git and github

pybricks https://pybricks.com/ https://code.pybricks.com/ and https://beta.pybricks.com/

And completely optional:
Lego Spike App https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/spike-app/software
Every once in a while you will need the official Lego Spike app. But know that if using pybricks, the Spike app will not be able to connect to the hub.
