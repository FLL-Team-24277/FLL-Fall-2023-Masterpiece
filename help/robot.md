## About our Robot

![Our Robot](https://github.com/FLL-Team-24277/FLL-Fall-2023-Masterpiece/blob/main/help/images/Robot_summer_2023_CompetitionBot.png)

Our robot uses a square design that enables wall following and wall squaring, which we use a lot. It has two large motors for driving and two medium motors for attachments. Our attachments can quickly drop on and be removed. Our robot has a light sensor, but not for line following. Instead, our light sensor can detect what attachment is installed and automaatically run the right program for that attachment with a single button push.

We use pybricks firmware, and do all of our coding in python. We use VS code for programming and github for backing up and sharing our code.
