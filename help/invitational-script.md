Hello!

We are Team #24277 Norfolk Collegiate O.A.K.S. We are pleased to tell you all about our team and our season. I am RJ and this is my first year with FLL.

A couple of things about our team: 1) we all think the most important FLL Core value is IMPACT. We actually consider IMPACT _THE reason_ that we do FLL. We all participate in FLL so we can make an impact in our community. Impact isn’t just a rule to guide us–it’s our team mission. The second most important thing to us is inclusion. All team members are involved with everything we do. 

Now I’d like to tell you about our project. First of all, we are very excited about this year’s theme. We tried to find a way to connect arts and technology, while helping solve some sort of problem. We met with the legendary space artist, Mr. Ron Miller, who has written and illustrated dozens of books about space. That's where we got the idea to write and illustrate a book about the NASA Europa Clipper Mission which is launching this fall. The Europa Clipper is a probe that will investigate Juputer's moon Europa and see if it could support life. Europa is an icy moon that has a liquid ocean and is considered one of the best possibilities for life beyond earth. Declan has some more information about our project.

The problem we are trying to solve is we want more people to know about the Clipper and missions like this, so that NASA can keep receiving funding. We think that people will naturally find Europa and the Clipper mission fascinating, but they just don’t know about it. We polled our entire school and only a couple of people (including teachers!) knew about Europa and the Clipper. This is the book that we wrote. Everyone we showed the book to said they learned something. We think that the more people know about these exciting missions will turn that desire to learn more into dollars for NASA and missions like this. This folder has pages listing everyone that we shared with and all of our sources of information. Now Jonas will tell you about our robot design.

As you can see, we use Spike Prime robots. We programmed in python with a special library called Pybricks. A few of us over the summer wrote a BaseRobot class to simplify and standardize the code for all of the team members. We have code samples in this folder. We also redesigned the base robot itself. For instance, we added this important light sensor to the front of the robot which can detect which attachment is installed on the robot and run the correct mission with just one button press. I also like the Lego weight that we put in the black of the robot, to make the robot so it isn’t so tippy. But my favorite design feature is the drop-on attachments. We can minimize our time in base significantly by using these. Speaking of attachments, we try to get the most out of our them by designing them to do multiple functions each. For instance, this attachment can solve six missions. We use Github for code sharing, which helps communication between team members. We would love to tell you more about our Engineering Design Process and our Quality assurance programs. Now Cadence will tell you about Core Values.

The first thing I want to talk to you about is IMPACT. As RJ mentioned, making an impact is very important to all of us. For example, last season we wrote the book that we showed you about Europa and the Clipper.We showed the book to many people and they all said they learned something from it. We also made an impact by helping other teams and doing community outreach. We met with a team from the UK and talked to them about how we use Python. We also volunteered at several different Lego and robotics tournaments in our region and even the state tournament. We even help coach our lower school lego robotics team. Finally we met with several other teams during the season to share our ideas. One other thing I’d like to mention is that everyone on the team was involved with everything that we do. We all had pages to write in the Clipper book, we all had to build our own attachments for the robot missions, and we all had to write our own programs to run those missions. The last thing I’d like to talk to you about is communication. Obviously, for any team to succeed, they must communicate. We have a system where we talk about changes we need to make with the robot and make sure everyone is aware of those changes. Similarly, since we all collaborated on the book together, it was important that we communicated any changes we needed to make with our sections. We didn’t want two people writing about the same thing.

Thank you for listening to our presentation and we are ready to answer your questions!
