These are vs code plugins that I think FLL teams will find useful:

Error Lens: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens
Git Autoconfig: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shyykoserhiy.git-autoconfig
GitHub Pull Requests: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github
Pylance: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance
Python: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

Middle School kids love to configure things like colors and fonts (ok, and so do adults). However, this can turn into a distraction. But these two plugins are quite nice and make it easier to configure vscode.
