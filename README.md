# Master-Program-Fall-2023

This is where all of the team code and master program will live for the Fall 2023 Masterpiece FLL Season.

How to use:

1. Each team member creates their own github account. REMINDER: Be sure to use an email account that they can check at school (github emails may be blocked).
2. Add each account as a collaborator for this project here: https://github.com/FLL-Team-24277/Master-Program-Fall-2023/settings/access (instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
3. The team member will need to confirm and accept the invitation. At that point they can push updates to the project.
4. In VS Code clone this repository. https://github.com/FLL-Team-24277/Master-Program-Fall-2023.git Save it somewhere in their documents folder
5. Add a python virtual environment. Ctrl-Shift-P > Python: Create Environment
6. Install the baseRobotLibrary (and pybricks as a dependency) pip install /path/to/wheelfile.whl (use a thumb drive)
7. Create a new python file, named "teamMemberName-test-mission.py", add a comment or two, and save it.
8. Commit the changes, and push. It will probably prompt for github registration/login and then sync all files. This link may help: https://pages.nist.gov/git-novice-MSE/08-collab/
